Problem Statement: Frog Jump II (LeetCode 2498)

You are given a 0-indexed integer array stones of length n, sorted in strictly increasing order, where each element represents the position of a stone in a river.
    - A frog starts on the first stone (stones[0] = 0) and wants to travel to the last stone (stones[n-1]) and then return back to the first stone.
    
    - The frog can visit each stone at most once.
    
    - The length of a jump is the absolute difference between the positions of the stone the frog jumps from and the stone it jumps to.
    
    - The cost of a path is the maximum jump length in that path.
    
Your task is to return the minimum possible cost of a valid path.

Solution 
--------------------------------
At first it look like DP problem , but letter we realise it simple logical problem. 


âœ… Solution Explanation

The frog must cover all stones exactly once (forward and backward trip).
The optimal strategy is:
    - On the way forward, skip every other stone.
    - On the way back, visit the skipped stones.
    - This guarantees that no jump is unnecessarily large.

Therefore, the answer is:
    - The maximum difference between stones[i] and stones[i-2] for all i >= 2.
    - Also consider edge jumps (stones[1] - stones[0] and stones[n-1] - stones[n-2]).

This works in O(n) time and O(1) extra space.
