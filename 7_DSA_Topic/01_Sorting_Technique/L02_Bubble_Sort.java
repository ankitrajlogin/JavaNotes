Bubble Sort 
    - Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm where adjacent elements are compared, and if they are in the wrong order, they are swapped. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

    - It is called Bubble Sort because, in each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array.


ðŸ”¹ Intuition
    - Imagine air bubbles in water:
        - The lighter bubble moves upward step by step.
        - Similarly, in Bubble Sort, larger elements keep moving (or "bubbling") to the end after each pass.

    - So after the 1st pass, the largest element is in its correct position.
After the 2nd pass, the 2nd largest element is in its correct position, and so onâ€¦
    - Eventually, the array becomes sorted.

ðŸ”¹ Algorithm (Step-by-Step)
    1. Start from the first element of the array.
    2. Compare the current element with the next element.
            - If the current element is greater â†’ swap them.
    3. Move to the next pair and repeat until the last element.
    4. After each pass, the largest element settles at the end.
    5. Repeat the above process for all remaining elements (excluding the sorted ones at the end).
    6. Stop when no swaps are needed (array is sorted).

// âœ… In short:
// Selection Sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it in the correct position. It is simple, requires fewer swaps than Bubble Sort, but is still O(nÂ²) and not suitable for large datasets.
