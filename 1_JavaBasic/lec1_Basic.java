// How Java programs are executed:
// 1. Compliation: The Java source code (.java file) is compiled by the Java compiler (javac) into bytecode (.class file).
// 2. Execution: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the bytecode, which is platform-independent.

// NOTES : 
// Java is a case-sensitive language, meaning that it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters.
// Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means it is based on the concept of objects that can contain data and methods.
// Java is a high-level programming language, which means it is designed to be easy to read and write for humans.
// Java is a compiled language, which means that the source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before it is executed.
// Java is a platform-independent language, which means that the same Java program can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
// Java is a strongly typed language, which means that every variable must be declared with a specific data type before it can be used.
// Java is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means it supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming.
